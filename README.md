# DATA.DB.100 Basics of databases

This repository contains all assignments that were done for my university's introduction to databases course.  
In this course we wrote **SQLite** and created ER diagrams and SQL database schemas.  
I didn't have much SQL experience before this course. I had only used SQL in a few small personal projects.

The tasks in H1-H6 should be quite uninteresting, especially since I didn't bother to type out the assignments for all those individual tasks, but the project we did for this course could be more interesting.  
The project is found from the [project folder](https://github.com/0x464e/data-db-100/tree/master/project) in this repository and I included all assignments for the whole thing in there.
